                        I give priority to the project of the company or client that you want to develop, thus doing the analysis, estimating time and tools that are going to be used and finally it is very important to know my limits.
                        Since if in this case it is a development that is out of my reach in the sense of time, I mainly prefer to say NO just out of ambition to win the project and lie to the client.

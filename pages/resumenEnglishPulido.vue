                        <p class="font-bold">What do we want to solve or create? </p> It is very common to come across many times that the client or user wants to solve or develop something in mind, however
                        By not having good advice or getting quick answers, this leads us to poorly applied development and investment, so there will be losses in all aspects within

                        <p class="font-bold">How do I work? </p> For me it is very important to know the line of business and the staff of the company to have an idea of ​​its way of working, however, something that I always
                        I give priority is the project of the company or client that you want to develop, thus doing the analysis, estimation of time and tools that are going to be used and finally it is very important to know my limits
                        Since if in any case it is a development that is out of my reach in the sense of time, I prefer to say NO just out of ambition to win the project and lie to the client.

                        to these questions, however, it will come to make a complex and large project, this and this would have to be negotiated in order to give a more visible scope of what is required to be developed and thus be more
                        Accurate with costs and times.

                I have the experience of working with large corporations over the years and with various teams.
                in a professional way making it the most intelligent in order to reach the assigned goals.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Over time this helped me learn how to sometimes resolve strange situations or rapid developments.
                applying the most appropriate technologies or tools for a better contribution to the project.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Working independently also helped me to develop more since with this it helped me to work with new
                languages ​​and know from the beginning developments forcing me to use good practices.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                This helped me a lot to understand to the clients the great importance of the reliability that they give me and that the projects that are developed
                be successful in order to leave the client satisfied with the results.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Finally I can only say that from the beginning of this degree I was self-taught and I always keep learning based on what is going
                presenting and needs that I require to complete my goals.
